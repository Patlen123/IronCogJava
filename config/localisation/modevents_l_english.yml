 modbritain.18.d: "The British government has approached us with a proposition. They say that if we were to join their faction as an ally, they would be willing to formally cede their ownership of Gibraltar back to us.

 modireland.1.t: "Britain Demands Union"
 modireland.1.d: "We have been put under intense pressure from the fascist government in Britain to surrender our sovereignty to the Union. Our troops are ready and willing to jump to Éire's defence once again, however the odds are certainly not in our favour. Many feel that to simply give in would not only be to surrender, but to also spit in the faces of the heroes of the Easter Rising who paid the blood price for our freedom."

 modgermany.1.b: "Gott strafe England!"

 modgermany.2.d: "After our recent annexation of Czechoslovakia, it is time for us to decide how the region shall be governed. While the Sudetenland's German population allows for the region to be directly ruled from Berlin, it may be wise to establish an autonomous government in Bohemia and Moravia. \n\nAn autonomous protectorate would also be able to utilise its resources in the region more efficiently than direct rulership from Berlin could, allowing for us to exploit a higher level of productivity."

 modgermany.4.t: "Establishing the Generalgouvernment"
 modgermany.4.d: "Now with Poland firmly within our grasp, we must decide how best to divvy up and administrate the region. One proposition is that we could establish a strict puppet government in the more ethnically Polish areas in the southeast, while the areas with large German populations are directly annexed into the Reich. \n\nThis concept would most certainly refine the efficiency to which we govern our territories, however it would devolve more powers from Berlin."
 modgermany.4.a: "Let us establish the Generalgouvernement."
 modgermany.4.b: "We shall rule all of Poland directly from Berlin."
 modgermany.5.t: "Expanding the Generalgouvernement"
 modgermany.5.d: "After pushing enemy forces out of former Polish territories in the southeast, we can now decide whether or not to transfer the occupation of the region to the Generalgouvernement. \n\nThis would allow for the efficient administration of the ethnically Polish and Jewish populations of Eastern Europe, as many of the Ukrainians in the region sympathise with our cause."
 modgermany.5.a: "Transfer the occupations to the Generalgouvernement."
 modgermany.5.b: "The Wehrmacht can adequately adminster the region."
 modgermany.6.t: "The Danzig Betrayal"
 modgermany.6.d: "We have received a telegram from the government in Danzig informing us that they do not wish to be incorporated into the Reich.

 modgermany.6.a: "We shall never forget this betrayal."
 modgermany.7.t: "Establishing Reichskommissariat Ukraine"
 modgermany.7.d: "With our advancing troops progressively securing more and more Soviet territory in Ukraine, we can finally begin to implement Generalplan Ost. In doing so, a colonial Reichskommissariat would be established to adminster the steady removal of the native Slavic population from Poland to the Eurasian Steppe, allowing for German colonists to then move in. \n\nProceeding with this move would guarantee the German people near limitless Lebensraum, however the remaining Slavs would never reconcile with us."
 modgermany.7.a: "Establish the Reichskommissariat."
 modgermany.7.b: "We don't need these phoney colonies."
 modgermany.8.t: "Danzig Rejoins the Reich"
 modgermany.8.d: "After our recent advance into Poland, the local NSDAP government in Danzig has quickly made preparations to rejoin the Reich once more. This shouldn't come as much of a surprise to the Polish government, particularly in light of many attempts to resist further integration into the nation.  \n\nThis day has been long anticipated both by the German people in the Reich, and the many torn away in Danzig by the Versailles criminals."
 modgermany.8.a: "Danzig ist Deutsch!"
 modgermany.9.t: "Establishing Reichskommissariat Ostland"
 modgermany.9.d: "With our advancing troops progressively securing more and more Soviet territory in the Baltic, we can finally begin to implement Generalplan Ost.

 modgermany.10.t: "Establishing Reichskommissariat Kaukasus"
 modgermany.10.d: "With our advancing troops progressively securing more and more Soviet territory in the Caucasus, we can finally begin to implement Generalplan Ost. In doing so, a colonial Reichskommissariat would be established to adminster the steady removal of the native Slavic population from Poland to the Eurasian Steppe, allowing for German colonists to then move in. \n\nProceeding with this move would guarantee the German people near limitless Lebensraum, however the remaining Slavs would never reconcile with us."
 modgermany.10.a: "Establish the Reichskommissariat."
 modgermany.10.b: "We don't need these phoney colonies."
 modgermany.11.t: "Establishing Reichskommissariat Moskowien"
 modgermany.11.d: "With our advancing troops progressively securing more and more Soviet territory in the Russian heartland, we can finally begin to implement Generalplan Ost. In doing so, a colonial Reichskommissariat would be established to adminster the steady removal of the native Slavic population from Poland to the Eurasian Steppe, allowing for German colonists to then move in. \n\nProceeding with this move would guarantee the German people near limitless Lebensraum, however the remaining Slavs would never reconcile with us."
 modgermany.11.a: "Establish the Reichskommissariat."
 modgermany.11.b: "We don't need these phoney colonies."

 modcomchina.1.a: "The Chinese people stand together!"
 modcomchina.2.t: "Mao's Proclamation"
 modcomchina.2.d: "Upon the defeat of the Kuomintang, Mao Zedong proclaimed himself chairman of the newly formed People's Republic of China atop the Tiananmen to a cheering crowd of Chinese countrymen. This marks a bold new chapter in Chinese history, as the young republic is bound to disturb the fragile balance of power in East Asia that has been preserved for many centuries."
 modcomchina.2.a: "The Republic is Proclaimed!"
 
 modsoviet.1.t: "Britain Requests Alliance"
 modsoviet.1.d: "The British have contacted us, requesting that they formally join the Comintern as our ally. While the British may prove a vital strategic ally in the war against capitalism and fascism alike, their interpretation of socialism can in some areas be at odds with our own. We must weigh up the benefits of this proposition."
 modsoviet.1.a: "We shall paint the world red together!"
 modsoviet.1.b: "We don't deal with revisionists"
 
 hongkong.1.t: "Acting Governor Appointed"
 hongkong.1.d: "As Sir Andrew Caldecott departs his position as 19th Governor of Hong Kong, acting governor Norman Lockhart Smith has been appointed to manage the port city until a new governor is formally appointed.

 hongkong.2.t: "New Governor Appointed"
 hongkong.2.d: "After a long and tedious process, Sir Geoffry Northcote has finally been formally appointed as 20th Governor of Hong Kong. Former acting governor Norman Lockhart Smith is expected to return to low level colonial administration until he is required again."

 modgreece.1.t: "Constantinople Reclaimed"

 modgreece.3.t: "Crowning the Basileus"
 modgreece.3.d: "Now with the holy city of Constantinople finally within our grasp once again, it is time to decide how our new empire is to be governed.

 modgreece.4.t: "The 4th of August Regime"
 modgreece.4.d: "Emboldened by the support of King George II, Ioannis Metaxas is beginning a coup to establish himself as head of government in Athens.

 modgreece.4.a: "It is time for Greece to be great once more!"

 modturkey.1.t: "The Ottoman Empire Resurgent"
 modturkey.1.d: "Given a drastic shift in the politics of Turkey, the lifetime of the young republic has taken a sudden and surprising nosedive into the confines of the history books. Governance of the nation has been restored to traditional rule, with democratic institutions in Ankara and Istanbul being shut down by state authorities. These may be the first signs that the former "sick man of Europe" is taking his first steps from his deathbed, embarking on a new rejuvenated quest of conquest and glory."
 modturkey.2.t: "Restoring Konstantiniyye"
 modturkey.2.d: "With the Turkish people now unified beneath a single centralised state, it would be wise to decide where best to establish the new regime.

For the time being, King Carol has appointed Miron Cristea as his prime minister, albeit with new restrictions in place.

 modpolitical.2.t: "Nationalist Sympathies"

 modfinland.1.t: "The Kivimäki-Ribbentrop Pact"
 modfinland.1.d: "As the last true vestige of bolshevism west of the Urals falls to our advancing forces in Moscow, the time has come for us to divide up the lands with our allies abroad. The Finns have long aided us in our efforts against the Soviet war machine, particularly in their valiant efforts during Operation Barbarossa. \n\nIt is only fair we compensate them for their losses in the great struggle; granting them ownership of their people's lands in Karelia should allow us to forge a new alliance."
 modfinland.1.a: "An excellent suggestion."
 modfinland.1.b: "The land belongs to the Reich."
 modfinland.2.t: "The Kivimäki-Ribbentrop Pact"
 modfinland.2.d: "The Germans have approached us with an interesting proposition. They are offering to cede us the entirety of Karelia from the defeated Soviet Union in return for a pact of friendship between our two nations. \n\nWe could choose to outright become a signatory of the Tripartite Act, thus joining Axis. Another option is to simply enter a pact of non-aggression in return, however we could also outright refuse any dealings so as to preserve our international neutrality."
 modfinland.2.a: "A toast to our new German allies!"
 modfinland.2.b: "Peace will be enough for now."
 modfinland.2.c: "We don't compromise our neutrality."
