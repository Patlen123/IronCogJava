After fighting through the streets, Canadian soldiers ransacked and looted the American capitol. This was followed by a grand celebration in which the White House was burned to the ground.

Massive amounts of artillery fire, carpet bombings and naval bombardment have left the city nearly flattened, and the sea has rushed in to take back most of it. Bhutanese soldiers have walked over the rubble to find almost nothing left. The pitiful American Army could not stand against their glorious fire."

Although most organized resistance has been crushed, the Italians are still facing a large insurgency, with frequent bombings and shootings keeping the Italian forces on their toes.\n\nThe occupation has affected none more so than the local Italian communities. The Italian occupiers have found both their largest amount of supporters, as well as the largest amount of insurgents as the area, and the local community is fiercely divided over its loyalties. For the Italian's part, many of the soldiers have begun abusing the locals, claiming that they ran away from Italia in her time of need. The future here seems uncertain."

The Japanese have already begun cracking down on them however, and hundreds have been rounded up and driven out of the city, with their families already being taken as well."

The soldiers, proud and waving at a camera man, pose from what was once the observation deck on the statue's head. Half of it has been blown away, giving them an open view of the city, and in the background, the melted stump of what was once the torch can be seen.\n\nThe statue was just one of many landmarks caught in the crossfire, and although the Americans claim the Spanish have razed a once beautiful city, the Spaniards have declared that the invasion was a liberation effort, and Spanish papers claim thousands of Americans in the streets celebrate the Spanish 'arrival'."

Although they now wear khaki instead of red, and carry rifles instead of flintlocks, the British have nevertheless made their return. Initially, a huge procession through Times Square and down the streets of the city were planned, but after a bomb went off in the gathering squadron of soldiers, killing twelve, all further parades have been cancelled, and the British soldiers have instead set about cracking down on the locals."

This stark reality has finally been realized as the Canadian Army has broken through the pickets around the city's outer limits and annihalted what remained of the American forces in the city.\n\nThe remaining Americans have gone to ground, sheltered by the local populace, and have continued their war from the shadows, striking out at isolated convoys or lone Canadians whenever given the chance.

Most of the city is now a smoking ruin, the US army having used every building, sewer and subway as a base to hold off the French forces.\n\nThrough flight or death, only half of the former population remains in the city, but for all intents and purposes, it is now French."
